<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Reflect on the preciousness of time with "memento mori" for Playdate.</p>
<p>This simple application provides a perspective on your estimated lifespan based on statistical data. After an initial setup, it displays:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your estimated life expectancy.</li>
    <li>The approximate time remaining in years, months, weeks, and days.</li>
    <li>The percentage of your estimated life already lived.</li>
</ul>
<p>The app also includes a handy "lockscreen" mode! When you turn this on, the screen updates just once per second (1 FPS) and the Playdate won't automatically lock. This lets you keep the display on all the time while using very little battery. Just a heads-up: because it updates so slowly, things might feel a bit less responsive in this mode.</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>Privacy Note:</strong> The information required for setup (country, gender, and date of birth) is stored <strong>only</strong> locally on your Playdate device. It is never transmitted or shared.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>Data Source:</strong> Life expectancy estimates are based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).</em>
</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>D-pad</strong> to navigate options during setup.</li>
    <li>Press the <strong>A button</strong> to confirm selections.</li>
    <li>Optionally use the <strong>Crank</strong> to scroll through lists or adjust values.</li>
    <li>The <strong>B button</strong> may be used to go back in menus (if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Life expectancy is estimated based on the average for your selected birth country, gender, and birth year.</li>
    <li>The underlying WHO data only includes male and female figures. If you select "Diverse", the app uses the male data as a fallback.</li>
    <li>Many countries are included, but if yours is missing, please let me know!</li>
    <li>Remember, these are statistical averages! Individual circumstances and lifestyle choices significantly impact actual lifespan.</li>
    <li>If you live beyond the estimate, the remaining time will show as 0. Congratulations on beating the average!</li>
